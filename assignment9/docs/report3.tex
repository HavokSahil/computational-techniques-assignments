\section*{Problem Statement}
The purpose of this problem is to \textbf{numerically solve} the two-dimensional Poisson equation

\[
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} +
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}
= -2\pi^2 \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)
\]

on the square domain:
\[
0 \le x \le 1,\qquad 0 \le y \le 1
\]

with boundary condition:
\[
u(x,y) = 0 \quad \text{for all boundaries}.
\]

The exact solution to this PDE is known:
\[
u(x,y) = \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y).
\]

This provides a good reference to verify the numerical method.

\section*{Methodology}

\subsection*{Finite Difference Discretization}

The domain is discretized using a uniform grid of size:
\[
N = 50,\qquad h = \frac{1}{N+1}.
\]

Using the second-order central difference approximation, the Poisson equation becomes:

\[
u_{i+1,j} + u_{i-1,j} + u_{i,j+1} + u_{i,j-1}
- 4 u_{i,j}
= -h^2 F_{i,j}
\]

where
\[
F(x,y) = -2\pi^2 \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y).
\]

Rearranging gives the classic \textbf{Jacobi iteration} formula:

\[
u_{i,j}^{(k+1)} =
\frac{1}{4}
\left(
u_{i+1,j}^{(k)} + u_{i-1,j}^{(k)} +
u_{i,j+1}^{(k)} + u_{i,j-1}^{(k)}
- h^2 F_{i,j}
\right).
\]

\subsection*{Implementation Steps}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Construct a \( (N+2) \times (N+2) \) grid including boundaries.
    \item Initialize \(u = 0\) everywhere (consistent with boundary conditions).
    \item Compute the forcing term \(F(x,y)\).
    \item Iterate using Jacobi updates until:
          \[
          \| U^{(k+1)} - U^{(k)} \|_\infty < 10^{-6}
          \]
    \item Visualize the final solution using a surface plot.
\end{enumerate}

Convergence is checked through the maximum absolute difference between successive iterates.

\section*{Results}

The Jacobi method converged within the specified tolerance.  
The resulting numerical solution reproduces the expected shape of the analytic solution \(u(x,y) = \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)\).

\begin{itemize}
    \item The solution exhibits a smooth peak at the center \( (0.5, 0.5 ) \).
    \item Boundary values correctly remain at zero.
    \item The surface plot clearly shows the symmetric sinusoidal structure.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Conclusion}

The Jacobi finite-difference method successfully solves the 2D Poisson equation on a square domain. The numerical solution matches the theoretical structure of the exact solution and demonstrates correct behavior under zero boundary conditions. Although Jacobi iteration converges slowly, it provides a simple and reliable method for validating PDE solvers.
